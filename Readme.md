This application requires Flask framework, flask_pymongo and also mongodb need to be installed locally to run this application.
I have made sure to get the local ip addr and run my server on this. \
This application requires python and flask framework to be installed. \
I have used MongoDB as a database to my application. \
Built Frontend to call the Api's that i've built.\
I have created UI modules to make use of the functionalities of this application.\
1) Implemented User Registraion and User login with authentication. 
2) Every user can create a note, 
3) delete a note by entering the corresponding id, 
4) update the contents of the note by entering the corresponding id 
5) and share their note with another user by entering username(case sensitive) and corresponding id. \ \
instructions to run  the application: \
Install MongoDb locally and Set environment variable of mongodb to path.\
Install Python 3 and install flask framework and pymongo package using pip \
pip install flask \
pip install pymongo \
pip install flask_pymongo \
After successful installation of all the dependencies proceed to run the application using command "python server.py" .\

I have attached a video to demonstrate how this application works.
